# Project 3 - ADC data transfer in double buffer using DMA

Contributors: Mohit Rane and Suman Hosmane

Description:
- Configuration on-board ADC of KL25Z to work in 16-bit differential mode for continuous sampling of input.
- Implementation a double buffer to store the sampled data using DMA.
- Developing an application for peak level detection of data and print real-time information using UART.

Installation Steps:
1. Add both projects present in the KDS folder.
2. Build ksdk_platform_lib_KL25Z4 first, and then hello_world_frdmkl25z.
